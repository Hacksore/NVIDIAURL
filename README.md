# GeForce Now Exploitation - a little writeup 

## Code generation algorithm
theres a algorithm the code, for the beta tester phase gets gernerated in. i will link it here, as soon as i write a little writeup.
untile then you can use https://www.joseph.sh/geforce/

## Disclaimer
all of this was tested in NVIDIA GEForce Now Version 1.8.2.17/po (EU Central).
I will only release the cmd.exe and admin exploit, its an LPE btw, if NVIDIA Doesn't contact me with any of their technicans, or securty officers,Â´, or something like that. No, I won't fill a normal form to report this as a bug.

## Restrictions
the task which scans for any malicious program, has been found out to be explorer_fake.exe, with the default PID 2788. 
If you stop the explorer_fake.exe you can make "start explorer.exe", to start the default explorer.
Restricted programs, which will crash NVIDIA GeForce now, with reporter key: 0x80030015:
- explorer.exe
- netsh lan/wlan

## Vulnerabilities
- Script injection and malicious program running by iSn0w \
      - This script injection vuln. leaded me to starting cmd and other exe programs from anywhere, as well as reading, and                                              writng to almost all locations.
- Program execution by JohnVS \
      - based on macro keys, he was able to run cmd as well as a powershell on the main system. read and write.

## Error codes
There are bunch of reporter keys, which appear when NVIDIA GeForceNow terminates the session.
